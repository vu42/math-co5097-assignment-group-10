    "Deep learning systems process vast amounts of data during training, and without statistical reasoning, it becomes difficult to judge whether observed changes in accuracy, loss, or generalization are meaningful. Statistics are tools to quantify uncertainty, evaluate estimates, and make principled decisions.\n",

    "- **Model evaluation**: Comparing estimators by using statistical bias, standard deviation, and mean squared error (MSE).\n",
