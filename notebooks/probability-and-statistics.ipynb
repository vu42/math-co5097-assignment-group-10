    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory provides the mathematical foundation for reasoning under uncertainty. In machine learning and artificial intelligence, we rarely have complete information about the world. Instead, we must make decisions and predictions based on incomplete or noisy data. Probability theory gives us the tools to quantify uncertainty, make principled inferences, and learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical methods extend probability theory to analyze real-world data, estimate unknown parameters, test hypotheses, and make predictions. Together, probability and statistics form the backbone of modern data science, enabling everything from spam filters to medical diagnosis systems to autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of probability theory and statistical inference, with particular emphasis on applications in computer science and machine learning. We begin with the axiomatic foundations of probability, develop the key concepts of random variables and distributions, and explore how these tools enable us to reason about uncertainty in computational systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Questions Addressed:**\n",
    "- How do we formally model uncertainty?\n",
    "- How can we update beliefs when we observe new evidence?\n",
    "- How do we make optimal decisions under uncertainty?\n",
    "- How do we learn from data when the underlying process is random?"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivating Problem: Spam Email Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the problem of automatically classifying emails as spam or legitimate. This problem exhibits all the key challenges that probability theory addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:**\n",
    "- **Uncertainty:** We cannot be certain whether an email is spam based solely on its content\n",
    "- **Partial Information:** We only observe the email text, not the sender's true intent\n",
    "- **Variability:** Different spam emails use different words and patterns\n",
    "- **Learning Required:** The system must learn what characterizes spam from examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of deterministic rules (e.g., \"if email contains 'FREE MONEY' then spam\"), we model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{Spam} \\mid \\text{Email Content})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability represents our degree of belief that the email is spam given the observed content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Bayes' Theorem:**\n",
    "$$P(\\text{Spam} \\mid \\text{Words}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Words} \\mid \\text{Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Spam})}{P(\\text{Words})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $P(\\text{Spam})$: Prior probability (base rate of spam)\n",
    "- $P(\\text{Words} \\mid \\text{Spam})$: Likelihood (how likely these words appear in spam)\n",
    "- $P(\\text{Spam} \\mid \\text{Words})$: Posterior probability (our belief after seeing the email)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This probabilistic framework allows us to:\n",
    "1. Quantify uncertainty rather than making hard decisions\n",
    "2. Update beliefs as we observe new evidence\n",
    "3. Make optimal decisions that account for different types of errors\n",
    "4. Learn from data systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "The same principles apply to medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, speech recognition, and countless other applications where uncertainty is inherent."

    "\n",
    "**Definition 12.1 ($\\sigma$-Algebra):**\n",

    "**Consequences:**\n",

    "**Answer: NO - We cannot apply Chebyshev independently to multiple averages from the same data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependence Through Shared Data:**\n",
    "   - If we compute multiple overlapping averages (e.g., $\\bar{X}_{m_1}$, $\\bar{X}_{m_2}$ using subsets of the same data), they are **not independent**\n",
    "   - Shared samples create correlation between the averages\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Union Bound Issue:**\n",
    "   - If we want $P(\\text{all k averages within } \\epsilon) \\geq 1-\\delta$, we might naively use:\n",
    "   $$P(\\text{at least one average exceeds } \\epsilon) \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^k P(|\\bar{X}_j| \\geq \\epsilon)$$\n",
    "   - This only works if the events are **mutually exclusive or positively correlated**, not generally dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correct Approach:**\n",
    "   - Use **union bound** (Bonferroni correction): Require each average to satisfy Chebyshev with probability $1 - \\delta/k$\n",
    "   - Or use **simultaneous concentration inequalities** (e.g., maximal inequalities)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "- ...\n",

    "These averages share $m-1$ samples, making them **highly correlated**.\n",

    "**Correct Statement:**\n",
